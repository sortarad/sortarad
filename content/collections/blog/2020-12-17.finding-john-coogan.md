        text: "There is nothing more fun than rediscovering forgotten pieces of neat software. Recently I came across this cool little game called ShipHunt. Someone was talking about it on Reddit and wondered if anyone had a key for it. One of the most frustrating problems with PalmOS software is that most of it was released as shareware and as the developers started disappearing so did the method of registering/removing the limits on the\_software."

        text: "I had this crazy idea to contact old PalmOS developers to convince them to either give users a way to generate their own keys or release a freeware version of their software. I had been emailing people for a while before I had my first success with John\_Coogan."

        text: "PalmOS programming actually started for me with TriLoan, a mortgage calculator. That was a different world and customer - realtors and bankers. \_So, not hackers! These customers were mostly not even interested in hacks. \_The registration was simple and I had a place in the code where the registration function returned a true/false. \_A hack showed up pretty quickly for\_TriLoan."

        text: "When I started writing ShipHunt I knew that gamers were much more likely to be hackers, and it would need a more robust registration. \_I recall that I broke the registration into several functions and I would move the separate functions around to different modules every time I recompiled. \_I even had false positives that would make ShipHunt appear to be enabled. \_It was an attempt to get the hacker to think they were successful. \_I did see hacks of ShipHunt, but none of them had the actual registration\_correct."

Apparently when the message popped up the officer disturbed the courtroom with a fit of\_laughter."
