        text: 'A long, long time ago in a galaxy far away there was a man name Nick who was desperate for new home. He recently fled the WordPress sector as he was tired of the Empire''s rule. He came to the Statamic Galaxy and met a wise man named Jack. Jack also felt the same way. He wanted to help keep the galaxy weird. Nick asked Jack to help him find a new home, somewhere he could express himself, somewhere he felt safe. Jack did just that, he found Planet Rad and helped Nick settle there.'
